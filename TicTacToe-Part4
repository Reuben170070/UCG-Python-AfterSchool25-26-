Goal: Make the computer play smart.

The computer chooses a move using this priority:

1. If I can win, do it
2. If the player can win next, block them
3. Take the center if it is free
4. Take a corner if one is free
5. Take a side if one is free


FOR each square
    Pretend O moves there
    IF that makes O win
        Place O there
        Stop

IF no winning move
    FOR each square
        Pretend X moves there
        IF that lets X win
            Place O there
            Stop

IF center is empty
    Place O there

ELSE IF any corner is empty
    Place O in a corner

ELSE
    Place O on any side
